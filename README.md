# Box it up Explore the Surface Area Volume and Potential Packing Possibilities:


## Objective:
Our objective is to provide a comprehensive solution that will output the optimal amount of surface
area or volume whichever is needed. We will provide the pizzeria with a program which will help
them calculate the surface area and volume along with the boxes that can be made.
## Introduction of the Problem:
The problem which we are tackling is that, a pizzeria wants to know in what way they can use
their resources in the best way to find the volume or surface area of a triangular pizza box which
they want to use in their pizza shop. They want to be able to input a value either the surface area
or volume, and receive the corresponding value such as the volume in case surface area is inputted
and vice versa. Then at the end, the max amount of boxes should be outputted that can be made
within the given budget

## Demonstration of the code:
1. The code start with the company name and the Developers introduction.
2. Then the program takes the general function of Volume and Surface Area.
3. It derivatives these functions. Getting the side of the isosceles triangle.
4. It then asks the user to select finding Surface Area or Volume.
5. It outputs the desired results with graphs.
6. After this the user is asked to enter Surface Area.
7. Using the surface area our program calculates how many pizza boxes can be made under a
budget of 2 million.
## Instruction manual:
1. Enter 1 to find Volume or 2 to find Surface Area.
2. Surface Area is calculated in meters so it should be under 0.1m - 19m.
3. Volume is calculated in meters so it should be under 0.1m - 9m
4. At the end the box count is displayed. The surface area is in cm.
So it should be greater than 100

## Conclusion:
With the help of graph and answers provided by Octave it is easier to find precise answers which
is hard to achieve in hand solutions as there can be errors in calculations. The problem was to
determine the volume of a triangular box if surface area was given and the results of the solution
were provided above. Difficulties faced were the running and writing of the code in octave as
differential was difficult to find due to an error in the equation created which was fixed later by
creating the hand written solution again. This is the end of the report all examples and process
were thoroughly explained
